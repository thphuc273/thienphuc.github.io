## 👋 About Me 

Hi, I'm Felix — a fresh graduate Information Technology student at the University of Science, VNU-HCM, with a strong passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Model Interpretability.

Over the past few years, I've been exploring the power of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems, from NLP model interpretability to student performance prediction and medical image segmentation. My goal is to build AI systems that are not only powerful, but also explainable and trustworthy.

## 🔬 My Research & Interests

- **Model Interpretability & Privacy**:  
  I recently conducted a thesis on _“Determining and erasing knowledge neurons in Transformer models”_, exploring how to selectively forget specific facts in BERT without hurting its overall performance — a growing area of interest in **responsible AI**.

- **End-to-End ML Applications**:  
  I’ve built and deployed multiple machine learning applications using **Flask**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD pipelines** — turning models into real-world products.

- **Computer Vision & NLP**:  
  From blood cell segmentation with **YOLOv9-Seg** to relational fact erasure in **Transformers**, I enjoy tackling both structured and unstructured data challenges.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Web & Cloud**: Flask, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline  
- **MLOps**: Git, CI/CD, Terraform (basic), Docker (basic)  
- **Visualization**: PowerBI, Tableau  
- **Currently exploring**: LangChain, Streamlit, MLflow, Kubernetes

## 🎯 My Mission

> I believe in the power of AI to create real impact — but also in the responsibility to build systems that are interpretable, fair, and human-centered.

Whether it’s tuning a regression model, deploying a segmentation app, or digging into the “neurons” of a Transformer, I’m always curious, always learning, and always aiming to build something meaningful.
